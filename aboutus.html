			<br><br><br><br>Our café is located in Lucknow. The café’s casual décor is perfectly suited for sipping a mug of steaming hot coffee with one of our homemade blueberry muffins on our sofa or for meeting colleagues for a business lunch at our handcrafted farmhouse table. When the weather cooperates, you can enjoy your meal on our lovely outdoor garden patio.<br><br>

Our menu features a variety of traditional breakfast favorites, homemade soups, fresh salads, generous sandwiches, thin crust pizzas, as well as daily specials to keep the menu fresh and creative. Our breakfast fare is served all day and brunch specials are offered on weekends.<br><br>

On Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays we’re open ‘til 8 pm and serve home-style dinner entreés as well as our full regular menu. We also offer a selection of moderately priced wines — available by the glass or full bottle, as well as bottled beers and a full bar.<br><br>

NOTE: The café is also available in the evening for private functions such as business/professional association dinner meetings, cocktail parties, anniversary and birthday celebrations, rehearsal dinners, pre-Bar/Bat Mitzvah dinners, etc. To discuss your event, please call 410-433-2233 and ask for Roseann.<br><br><br>
